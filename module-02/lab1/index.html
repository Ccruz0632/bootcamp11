    <h1>This a heading 1 element</h1>

    <div>
      This is the start of a really short paragraph. It has some other nested tags to emphasise/highlight some of the text. For example:
      <br>
      <b>This is bold text.</b>
      <br>
      And, even more exciting:
      <br>
      <em>This is italic text!</em>
    </div>
    
    <article class="row">
        This is a paragraph explaining the image below.
        Remember: images use a self-closing tag, and the image URL is set by the "src" attribute.
      </article>
    
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/360x100.png/BB5500" />
    
    <h3>This is a subheadline wrapped in "h3" tags.</h3>
    
        <div>
            If we have a URL like the one at the end of this paragraph then it should be hyperlinked using the correct tag:
            <a hfer="https://www.google.co">  https://www.google.co </a>
         </div>
    
            <p>Please wrap my favourite YouTube video below in the correct tag</p>

    <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
     into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
     passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.  </p>
